This project is my third project in my Frontend (React+Tailwind) journey. The focus of this project is Tailwind. The goal is to design a set of pages with Tailwind. The pages are from a customer requirements specs given by a client on an online freelancing site. The pages are accessed through links in the footer.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
